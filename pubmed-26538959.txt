AB  - The canines being the cornerstone of the arch and smile is one of the teeth, which 
      has the longest eruption passage that gets influenced by local and general 
      etiological factors easily. The initial calcification of the crowns starts at 4-5 
      months of age and proceeds toward eruption about 11-13 years of age with mesiobuccal 
      crown angulation that gets corrected toward occlusion. It gets displaced buccally or 
      palatally or may sometimes get impacted. Early intervention is the best suited to 
      manage canine eruption patterns. Once erupted ectopically, they possess a great 
      challenge in repositioning them back into their correct position. This case report 
      discusses an orthodontic treatment planning and execution to correct a buccally 
      placed canine with an anterior crossbite in an adult.
